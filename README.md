# Mars Weather Application

This application uses an API to connect to NASA's InSight weather station on Mars. It fetches the maximum and minimum temperatures for each sol on Mars and displays them. It also has the functionality to convert the temperatures from celcius to farenheight.

## Mars attack

There is currently an issue with NASA's InSight weather station on Mars that is preventing new data from being transmitted.
To demo how the application works I have added a JSON file of mock data that is connected to the application.
